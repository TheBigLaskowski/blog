![Joe Laskowski](/assets/joe-laskowski.png){: .profile-img } Hi! I’m Joe. I’m a web developer in training from South Bend. This blog is a place for my thoughts and things. A lover of Linux, craft beer, and mixed martial arts, I’ve been a computer nerd in one way or another for the past 18 years. Here I will rant, teach, and inform you about said interests. When I’m not enjoying a tasty IPA and watching UFC fights, or writing code on my Linux computer you can find me spending time with my family.

Want to work together? You can find me on social media with the links below or you can send me a message on my [contact page](/contact). I’d love to hear from you.
