![Joe Laskowski](/assets/joe-laskowski.png){: .profile-img } Hi! I’m Joe. Some call me Poppa Joe. I’m a web developer newbie in training from South Bend. This blog is a place for my thoughts and things. A lover of Linux, craft beer, and mixed martial arts, I’ve been a computer nerd in one way or another for the past 18 years. Here I will rant, teach, and inform you about said interests. When I’m not enjoying a tasty IPA and watching UFC fights, or writing code on my Linux computer you can find me spending time with my family.

At some point in my developer journey I would love to work with up and coming breweries in the booming craft beer industry. It would also be awesome to specialize in development for mixed martial artists and fight promotions. I’m not sure yet where this journey will take me, but I’m very excited about all the possibilities.

Want to work together? You can find me on social media with the links below or you can send me a message on my [contact page](/contact). I’d love to hear from you.
