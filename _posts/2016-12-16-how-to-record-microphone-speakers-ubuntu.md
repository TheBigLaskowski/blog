On any given day I receive 20 to 50 phone calls. I utilize Google Hangouts on my desktop so I can work hands free. I previously used the program Audacity to record important phone calls. This required me to enable monitor mode in the Pulse Audio settings, as well as entering a few commands into the terminal to enable a loop back mode. Together, these settings enabled a stereo mix, required so my microphone and speakers could work concurrently. This was not an ideal setup, and while speaking you can hear yourself talking, it made it difficult to hold a normal conversation.

I recently upgraded my distro Xubuntu to the LTS version 16.04, and was hoping to find a new solution to record from the microphone and speakers simultaneously. A Google search for “Linux + stereo mix” eventually led me to discover a cross platform open source program called [Open Broadcaster Software Studio](https://obsproject.com/).

OBS Studio can do so much more than record Hangouts and Skype calls, however my initial interest was peaked when I discovered that OBS had already implemented a stereo mix that works right out of the box. Unlike the Audacity method, OBS requires no manual configuration in PulseAudio, or enabling a loop back mode via the command line.

### [OBS Ubuntu Installation](https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio/wiki/Install-Instructions#linux)

* FFmpeg is required. If you do not have the FFmpeg installed (if you're not sure, then you probably don't have it), you can get it with the following commands:

**For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**, FFmpeg is not officially included so you will need a specific PPA:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kirillshkrogalev/ffmpeg-next
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

**For Ubuntu 15.04 and following versions**, FFmpeg is officially included:

```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

* Then you can install OBS with the following commands:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install obs-studio
```

Once you have OBS Studio installed all you have to do is add your audio output capture and the audio input capture in the source panel. These settings will use the default microphone and speaker selections in your PulseAudio volume control panel.

That's it! Start recording and you are good to go. This works perfect with Skype, Hangouts and any other program that you require recording two way audio. I have OBS set to minimize to the system tray where I can simply click on the indicator icon to start and stop recording when needed. Enjoy and if you have any questions leave a comment below the video on YouTube.
