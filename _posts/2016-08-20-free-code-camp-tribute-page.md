I completed the first challenge at Free Code Camp a few weeks back. The assignment was to create a simple tribute page and dedicate it to anyone I wanted to make it about. I had Muhammad Ali fresh on the brain as he had recently passed away in early June. Muhammad Ali was a legend in the sport of boxing, a supreme idol to a bevy of today’s top combat sport athletes. This project is not my first rodeo with HTML or CSS, I’ve taken several courses over the years from [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/), [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), and at [treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com). I never picked up much momentum after learning the nuts and bolts of each markup language, I tend to get sidetracked easily and move my interests in different directions. This was however my first time trying out [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), better late than never right? I can see why this framework is so popular, it makes starting a new project a piece of cake. 

I’ve moved onto my next challenge at FCC to create a personal portfolio. The instructions are to create one page scrolling website with multiple sections. I’ve been dragging my ass this past month on this project, as I mentioned before I get sidetracked easily. I have the basic structure of the project put together but then took off on a side tangent to learn and implement [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is why I’m writing on this blog right now. It seems when learning web development each new implementation of a framework leads you down a rabbit hole of endless options to improve your project with additional frameworks and tools. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to set tasks and minify your code, learning about Jekyll includes and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) code snippets, [Bower](https://bower.io/) to add these frameworks with ease to your project, [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to optimize delivery of your pages. The list goes on and on, it’s hard to stay focused on your original task when each new turn you discover a better way or a more efficient solution.

I can't complain much I’m still learning a ton about development in between my challenges at FCC and might pick up a thing or two that helps my upcoming projects. Jekyll is pretty awesome, it's even helped me learn the basics of git. I will put it down for a bit and get back to my personal portfolio assignment soon. It was fun making the tribute page, I enjoy being creative and it was a good brush up on HTML and CSS to knock a little rust off my skill sets. Soon I will be onward to learning JavaScript, which so far looks like a scary ocean filled with great white sharks.
